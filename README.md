# Stellarium bot
Telegram bot to track Stellar accounts

To start using Stellarium bot, click [this link](https://t.me/stellariumbot) or search @StellariumBot in your telegram contacts.

Most web wallets / exchanges cannot send you notifications when an event occurs in your account.
StellariumBot sends you a Telegram message every time an event occurs in your account that alters your balances.

I have written this bot for my own use, but I think it can be useful for more people.

To start tracking an account, start the bot with the command:
```
/start stellar_account
```
Example:
```
/start GB2SWTADAJHQOE5L5DZ5RHFD3G2U6KW7HMDTIZWIWH5WDGZF4AAEAJGX
```
If you want to keep track of multiple accounts, you can create a telegram's group for each one.

To stop tracking and delete all information about your account, send ```/stop``` command.
